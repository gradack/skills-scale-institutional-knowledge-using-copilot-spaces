## Communication Gap Indicators

Watch for these signs that communication is breaking down:
- Repeated questions about the same topic
- Missed deadlines due to misunderstandings
- Conflicting information from different sources
- Team members feeling "out of the loop"
- Decisions being made without proper input
- Blockers not being escalated or resolved
- Stakeholder surprise at demos or updates

If you notice these patterns, use this checklist to identify and address communication gaps.
